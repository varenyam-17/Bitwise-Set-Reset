Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements
Theory:Bitwise shift operators in C++ are powerful tools for manipulating data at the binary level. They allow you to shift the bits of an integer either to the left or right, which is often used for efficient arithmetic operations and low-level programming.

ðŸ”§ Bitwise Shift Operators in C++
1. Left Shift (<<)
- Syntax: a << b
- Effect: Shifts the bits of a to the left by b positions.
- Equivalent to: Multiplying a by 2^b



2. Right Shift (>>)
- Syntax: a >> b
- Effect: Shifts the bits of a to the right by b positions.
- Equivalent to: Dividing a by 2^b
